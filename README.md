# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Execute the data cleaning and transforming techniques learned throughout the program.
Create and put into action a quality assurance (QA) procedure to compare and verify the transformed data with the original raw data.
Provide insights into business operations and trends through the analysis of data.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 

When changes were made in the names of the columns, I kept getting this error:
ERROR:  cached plan must not change result type 

Opening a new query tool solves the issue

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
